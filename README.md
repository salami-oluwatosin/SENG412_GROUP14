### Features

- **Home Page**: Displays an organized list of group members, their matriculation numbers, and the courses they have registered for.
- **Payroll Calculator**: A tool designed for small companies (50+ employees) to calculate gross pay, net pay, and deductions based on hours worked and hourly rates.
- **GPA Calculator**: Allows group members to calculate their 1st-semester Grade Point Average (GPA) using an A-F scale (5.0 scale).
- **Personal Details**: Provides additional personal information about group members, such as their state of origin, blood group, phone numbers, and hobbies.
- **Responsive Design**: The application uses a unified CSS stylesheet to provide a professional and responsive user interface across all modules.

### Technologies Used
